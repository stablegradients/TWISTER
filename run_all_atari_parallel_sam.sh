# All Atari100k Games Parallel Training Script with SAM
# Runs each selected game with 4 seeds in parallel on 4 GPUs using SAM optimizer
# Comment out games you don't want to run on this machine
#
# USAGE:
#   1. Edit the ATARI_GAMES array to select which games to run
#   2. Edit WANDB_ENTITY to match your wandb account
#   3. Optionally modify GPUS array for different GPU configurations
#   4. Run: ./run_all_atari_parallel_sam.sh
#
# FEATURES:
#   - Uses SAM optimizer with rho=0.1 (non-adaptive)
#   - Runs 4 seeds per game in parallel on 4 GPUs
#   - Automatic wandb run naming with SAM suffix
#   - Progress tracking and error reporting
#   - Configurable for different machine setups
#
# WANDB RUN NAMES:
#   - Format: seed_{seed}_{run_name}_SAM_rho0.1
#   - Groups experiments by base name + SAM parameters
